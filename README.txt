README

This repository exists as a BACKUP of the actual files, which can be accessed and edited at users.opensciencegrid.org/wp-admin (if you have editing privileges). If a file is in the legacy files list, then it's not currently in use but should be kept in the even that it's needed.  (For questions on file names, look on the Wordpress Codex under template hierarchy.) If there is a * in the file name (e.g. category-*.php), it means anything of that form is legacy (e.g. category-3.php, category-qcd.php).
